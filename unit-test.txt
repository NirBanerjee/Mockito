Unit - Testing

Unit testing is where we test our code at a unit or class level. Usually test the public methods for both positive and Negative scanarios.  

Unit Testing - Mock out the dependecy layers. Each layer is unit tested on its own

1. When we write unit tests, we catch bugs during dependencies. 
2. Instant feedback. As everything is mocked.
3. Regression Suite - Making sure no code breaks as a result of newer features and code updates.

Testing Framework - 

Every unit testing framework gives us 3 things - 
1. An easy API to write unit tests
2. An easy way to assert for results.
3. A way to run and report results.

JUnit 3 -> junit.framework.TestCase
JUnit 4 -> Annotations
            @Test -> Each Test Case
            @Before -> Setup before each test case execution
            @After -> Method executed after each test case execution
            @BeforeClass -> Executes once before the full test class
            @Ignore -> Those tests are ignored.

            Provides easy to use static methods
            1. assertNotNull
            2. assertEquals
            3. assertSame

            Provides BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class to execute Test Suite. Can be extended
